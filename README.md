# Training Source Manager

A light tool for managing and tagging source files, for example to use for training AI.
With full support for drag'n drop and double click.

Dragging one or multiple files into the window will create a new source entry with the files attached, while dragging them into the file list of an existing source will attach them to that.
Similarly dragging files into windows will export those files to the specified folder.

Double clicking files will export them to %tmp% and open them.
